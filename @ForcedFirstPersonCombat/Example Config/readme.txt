This is the default file that will be generated by the server the first time it starts. If you want to skip this step create a folder within the server profile folder called "ForcedFirstPersonCombat" and then rename and input one of the example JSON files

>Toggle Melee - 0/1 (Will disable or enable if the mod effects all melee weapons)
>Toggle Guns - 0/1 (Will disable or enable if the mod effects all guns)
>Toggle Grenades - 0/1 (Will disable or enable if the mod effects all grenades)
>Switch Delay - 0 and up (0 will disable the timer, the delay will start after the player removes a valid weapon from there hand, the player won't be able to switch back to 3pp until this time has expired)
>Whitelist overlay - Item Classes (Items here are ignored by the mod, regardless of other settings, players will be able to enter 3pp while holding any of the items on this list)
>Debug toggle - 0/1 (99% of the time you won't need this)

In the folder where you found this readme there are two JSON examples *DO NOT* just copy them into the profile ForcedFirstPersonCombat folder - the JSON file would need to be renamed to just "ForcedFirstPerson" first in order to work
