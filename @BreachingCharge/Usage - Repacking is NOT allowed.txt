The fact that I have to include this in the mod is stupid enough in itself so if you repack, modify or reupload this mod don't be suprised when you receive a dmca claim or get blacklisted from using the mod

Modifying the mod through the proper means is obviously allowed, e.g. using the override and modded keywords in the code and so on, just don't repack anything
If you are not sure if the modification you are doing is alright or not just message me on discord or steam and I'll let you know
