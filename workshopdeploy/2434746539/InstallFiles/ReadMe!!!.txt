Thanks for subscribing!!!
There are Two objects that have been added for fun :)
The classnames are as follows

RP_GiantSpongeMedium
RP_GiantSpongeLarge

Basically two huge Spongebob models. Admin use only, Zero geometry. So you'll walk through it/fly....
May remove in the future, just thought it was funny :)

You need to delete using ESP.

If your using VPPAdmin Tools, use the filter "Inventory Base" to find the object.
Im guessing its the same for other admin tools.
(Its classified as a "Barrel" in the config :)

Since the new big update, I've added a cannabis mask. There are retextured vanilla clothes to match. 
If I used NPC's for traders Id try those for a drug trader. Do as you wish, thought it was neat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some masks(One or Two)are re-texturable, some are not. The intention was to just get them in and working :P
You'll need to figure that out though.
